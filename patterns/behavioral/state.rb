# Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
# The object will appear to change its class.

# Each call to state defines a new subclass of Connection that is stored in a
# hash. Then, a call to transition_to instantiates one of these subclasses and
# sets it to the be the active state. Method calls to Connection are delegated
# to the active state object via method_missing
